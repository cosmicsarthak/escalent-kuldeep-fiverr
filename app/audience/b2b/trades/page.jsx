            Obtaining opinions of busy tradespeople can be quite a task, as it
            often involves reaching out through various channels to ensure a
            good response rate. RONIN offers multiple communication options,
            including phone, screen, and online interviews, to accommodate
            individuals who are not desk-based. Additionally, we can conduct
            straightforward phone interviews for those who prefer that method.
            Tradespeople in the construction, HVAC, plumbing, boiler
            engineering, mechanic, pipefitting, landscaping, and technology
            installation industries might range from solo practitioners to those
            employed by bigger companies.

                An internet-based and mobile phone project that combines
                different methodologies. Customer sample lists were provided for
                trade pain purchasers. They were initially contacted by email
                for via the internet completion, and then failure to respond
                were followed up with phone calls. Because tradesmen do not
